This was a fun project to work on. I love Pokemon and have been playing the games since I was little so I really enjoyed getting to work with them again for this.

I originally wanted to make a battle simulator for my project where you would be able to search up any pokemon and would get to pick from their moves in order to battle an opponent. This unfortunately proved to be very difficult to implement and I was unable to do it. I was unable to get the webpage to generate a random opponent pokemon and I was unable to get it to generate four random moves from each pokemon's moveset. I decided to then have the project about seeing which pokemon was stronger than charizard. I did this by adding their attack and defense stats and comparing them to charizard's. This was a much better solution. 

Overall I really enjoyed being able to have my project be about Pokemon and I really liked being able to make something cool that I can show off to my friends!
